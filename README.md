# About the Project

This is a project done when I was attending the Full-Stack coding bootcamp at Concordia University.

# Running The Project

Run `yarn instal` followed by `yarn dev`

# What has been implemented

- A dataset containing 20 words, including a hint to make it easier to guess the word. If the user clicks on the hint, they will lose 1 point

- Score, starting at 10. Each miss will have the user lose 1 point.

- Autofocus and form reset once user submits the letter

- If user wins, the name of the word correctly guessed is displayed as well as a winning message

- If user loses, a losing message is displayed

- Created 2 main endpoints that in a way that the word is never exposed to the frontend

- Added a middleware to validate the wordId input coming from the FE

- Added a favicon to the page

- Misses DIV to let the user know what guesses were misses
